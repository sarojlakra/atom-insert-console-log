# atom-insert-console-log package

Quickly insert console.log statements around your selection

## Features

Quickly insert console.log statements around your selection by hitting <keyboard>CTRL</keyboard>-<keyboard>ALT</keyboard>-<keyboard>L</keyboard>.

## Supported languages

Currently, only JavaScript is supported. This is because the package is dumb and only inserts `console.log(${selection});` right now. Yes, that's a semicolon. And you're gonna like it.
